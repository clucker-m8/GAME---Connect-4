# GAME---Connect-4
Connect four is a multiplayer game where you take in turns until one payer has 4 linking symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

The game start with a tutorial, that can be skipped if you pass the 'skip_tutorial' (optional) argument a True boolean value.
In the game, there are two symbols which each player will use: 'X' and 'O'.
When the game starts, take note that the 'X' symbol always starts first.
You take in turns placing your symbol in any column available to you, that includes colums 1 through 7.
Pick the column's number, enetr it into the console and watch as your turn is pressed!


And that's essentially what the game is. I plan to add an option to play against a bot in the case of having nobody to play with, but that's a plan for another time.
For now, this is the project, hoper you enjoy!
